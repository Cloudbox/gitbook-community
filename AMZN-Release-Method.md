**This method is deprecated if you are using Sonarr v3 as it has the quality definitions of `WEBRip / Bluray-1080p Remux`**

## Grabbing a quality release through the power of [must contain]:

Want to ensure you download a good quality [WEB-DL] until a BluRay comes out? Want to avoid being stuck with a poor WEB release from another release group?
***
**Pro's of using this method:**
* End up with quality AMZN [WEB-DL 1080p] immediately, [BluRay-1080p] later.

**Con's of using this method:**
* If [WEBRip] comes out later, you're stuck with the WEB-DL unless you grab _manually_. This will likely be solved with the release of Sonarr v3.
* Older TV shows in [DVD][SD] quality tend to suffer. This method forces 720p and up and this often means you won't get a release.
***

If you **_still_** want to use the method after weighing up this decision, follow these steps...

* In Sonarr, go to Settings, Indexers, Restrictions.

Set the following: 

**Must contain:** AMZN, HDTV, NF, Netflix, CasStudio, Amazon, BluRay, 720p, .iP.,

* Add AMZN tag to shows. [Side note: [Traktarr](https://github.com/l3uddz/traktarr) can do this for you automatically!]

* Enjoy good quality [WEB-DL] on future content.
